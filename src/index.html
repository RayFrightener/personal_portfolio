    <p>Hey!</p>
    <p>My name is Pranshu Chawla.</p>
    <p>This website is a portfolio containing all projects I've worked on!</p>  
    <p>I am on the path to becoming a full-time remote web developer, a skilled professional who will design, develop, and maintain web applications from a remote location. I am building a comprehensive understanding of front-end, back-end, and database technologies, which will enable me to create robust, scalable, and user-centric web solutions. As I continue to grow into this role, I am honing my skills in independent problem-solving, effective communication, and time management, all with the goal of consistently delivering high-quality work within project deadlines and budgets. This vision represents the person I am becoming, dedicated to mastering the craft and achieving excellence in the field of web development.</p>
